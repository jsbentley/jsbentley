Hi, 
I'm John, a former astronomer and aspiring data scientist.

I completed a PhD in 2021 at UNSW, Sydney Australia with a thesis entitled "Aspects associated with the use of M-dwarf stars in exoplanet searches".

Since then I have been broadening my data analysis skills to include machine learning, databases, and natural language processing.

I can be contacted at jsbentley@gmail.com.
